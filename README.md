## NREL 2FBR pyrolyzer

The NREL 2FBR system consists of a bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) reactor for biomass fast pyrolysis. Computational models for evaluating the operation of this BFB pyrolyzer are available in this repository.

See the [CCPCode website](https://ccpcode.github.io) for an overview of models available for the NREL 2FBR system.
