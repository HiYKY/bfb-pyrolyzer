# BFB pyrolyzer

This repository contains Python code for modeling a bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) biomass reactor operating at fast pyrolysis conditions. The model can be applied to other BFB reactors given the appropriate parameters and reaction mechanisms. See the [mfix-bfb-pyrolyzer](https://github.com/ccpcode/mfix-bfb-pyrolyzer) repository for a CFD example.

## NREL 2FBR pyrolyzer

The NREL 2FBR system consists of a 2-inch diameter bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) reactor for biomass fast pyrolysis. Computational models for evaluating the operation of this BFB pyrolyzer are available in this repository.

Visit the [CCPCode website](https://ccpcode.github.io) for an overview of computational models and CFD simulations available for the NREL 2FBR system.

## NREL DCR pyrolyzer
